### **Problem Statement: Sieve of Eratosthenes**

The **Sieve of Eratosthenes** is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer. The algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.

#### **Task**

You are given a number `n` and you need to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. You need to return a list of all prime numbers up to `n` in increasing order.

#### **Input**

- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)

#### **Output**

- A list of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.

#### **Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: n = 10
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

#### **Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: n = 30
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
```

#### **Constraints**

- The input number `n` can be as large as 10^6, so your solution should be efficient enough to handle this upper limit.

#### **Explanation**

- In the example `n = 10`, the prime numbers less than or equal to 10 are `[2, 3, 5, 7]`.
- In the example `n = 30`, the prime numbers less than or equal to 30 are `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]`.
